# # The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# # A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# # followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# # build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# # Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

#   # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
#   assets:
#     - assets: "C:/Users/mohna/Pictures/contact_less (1).png"
#     - assets: "C:/Users/mohna/Desktop/contact_less.png"

#   # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
#   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
#   # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#   # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#   # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#   # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#   # example:
#   fonts:
#     - family: CourrierPrime
#       fonts:

#         # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#         #   style: italic
#     - family: Lato
#       fonts:
#         - asset: "C:/Users/mohna/Desktop/Lato-Regular.ttf"
#         - asset: "C:/Users/mohna/Desktop/Lato-Bold.ttf"
#           weight: 700
